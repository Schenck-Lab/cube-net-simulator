## Cube-Net Simulator


### Intro
**Cube-Net Simulator** is a browser-based interactive 3D tool that visualizes the transformation between a cube (3D) and a user-selected net (2D). Users can select different net types, base-face positions, and animation modes to explore how net folds into cube, and unfolds back. This tool is built with React and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for high-performance WebGL rendering.
